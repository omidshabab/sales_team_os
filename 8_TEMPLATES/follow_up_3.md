Owner role: SDR
Last updated: 2025-12-25
Purpose: Close the loop gracefully; invite future outreach.
How to use (1-2 lines): Send Day 12; leave door open; include booking link.

If now’s not right, totally fine. I’ll close the loop on my end. If priorities change, here’s my link: [Calendly]. Wishing you a strong quarter.
